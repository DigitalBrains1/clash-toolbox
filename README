This is a collection of small or rather small pieces of code I often use
while designing in C位aSH.

Some of this code dates back to C位aSH v0.3.3, but this repository is created
fresh for C位aSH v1.0.1. Some of the code might even depend on features not
yet in any released version of C位aSH. No attempt has been made to precisely
indicate these dependencies.

The module hierarchy below Test mirrors the top-level hierarchy, so
"tests" for Toolbox.ClockScaler are in the hierarchy rooted at
Test.Toolbox.ClockScaler.

These tests can be unit tests, other types of tests and example top entities.
These last not only serve as a way to test code, but also as an example of
how to use it.

The directory quartus/ offers some Intel Quartus projects in the hope that
they might be useful for a quick start with those top entities.
